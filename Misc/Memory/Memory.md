# Memory Techniques 

Memory techniques are a particular interest of mine.  The websites below are a place to store some of the things I have accumulated in my mind.

### General Info
In Mary Carruthers' **The Book of Memory**, she points out that for hundreds of years in Medieval Europe, memory techniques were a standard part of the curriculum.  Students were taught from an early age how best to use their minds to memorise so that they would not forget their lessons.  Moreover, all monks were expected to memorise the Psalms within 6 moths to 2 years upon entering the monastery.  Speaking the Psalms takes over 3 hours!  

While I am not a monk, I am a data scientist, and I am expected to keep up with the latest trends in ml.  If I cannot quickly put this information into memory, I cannot quickly develop models that will help my company.  Moreover, using the memory techniques has been a good way to memorise certain chapers of the Gospel of John.
