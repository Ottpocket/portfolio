# Mullen Mandarin Chinese Character-Location System 

This following system is built upond Alex Mullen's Chinese system outlined [here](https://mullenmemory.com/memory-palace/chinese-system-part-2). At its core, 
every Chinese base sound has a character, all endings have a location, and each location is divided into 4 for each of the tones.
