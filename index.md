[University of Liverpool Ion Switching Competition](https://github.com/Ottpocket/Ion_Switching)

For this competition, I was tasked with predicting the number of ion channels open every ten-thousandth of a second given electrophysiological signal data for that time stamp.  I used wavenet with a dual loss for regularization to predict this information.
